## Project Purpose
This Project serves as a playground for me to maintain my code as I work through various miscellanious DAML projects as I learn the language. 

## Digital Asset
If you're here from Digital Asset to look at my submission, please find the 'BikeRentals.daml' and 'TestBikeRentals.daml' files located within the 'daml' directory. Please note that in its current state, the Purchase Contract and test Script is not functioning quite as I would like, but I have included it as I still think it's a valuable piece of code to show and continue to iterate upon.
